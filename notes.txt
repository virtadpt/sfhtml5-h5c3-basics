Block elements:
	h1-h6, p, div, blockquote, pre, br
		<div> is a generic box. they stack vertically on the page.
		<pre> is preformatted text.  lines are not wrapped.
		probably <code> as well
		<br> doesn't need a closing tag anymore.
		<p> autocloses, too.
		<img> tags autoclose.

Inline elements
	span, b, i, s, u, cite
		<s> (strikethrough)
		<cite> - citation
	these tags all have special meaning for speech readers.
	<em> is emphasized when it's spoken out loud.
	<b>, <i>, et al are ignored by assistive tech.

Lists
	ul, ol, dl; li, dt, dd
		<ul> - bulleted list
		<ol> - ordered/numbered list
		<dl> - list of definitions
		closing </li>'s are no longer needed.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
	selectors match parts of HTML pages.
	properties change how what is selected is drawn by the browser.

	p { font: 12px/14px sans-serif }
	"p" is the selector (the tag)
	"font: 12px/14px sans-serif" is a set of properties that set a font and
		a font size on all instances of that selector.
	means:
		font-style: normal
		font-size: 12px
		line-height: 14px
		font-family: sans-serif
	value/value: height of text/height of line
	always assumes 96 pixels/inch (thank you, Microsoft)

	out of two dozen selectors, you really only need to know 3.
	classes are ways of grouping kinds of blocks of HTML.

body	{
	font-family: Ariel;
	font-size: 12pt;
	color: black;
	}
h1 { color: blue }
.intro { font-style: italic }

<body>
<h1>Hello, world.</h1>
<p class="intro">This is my first paragraph.</p>

<p class="intro" id="part2">This is my second paragraph.</p>
</body>

If the browser encounters a CSS selector that it doesn't understand (like IE9
running into an rgba(x, y, z, alpha) directive) it silently ignores it.

Web-safe colors are no longer a thing.
They were from a time when 8-bit colour depth was the most common limit, and
you had to pick from a color palette that was guaranteed to render on
everything.

Classes (like intro) are specified in CSS with dots:
.intro { color: blue }
<section id="intro">
	Stuff...
</section>

#intro p { font-style: italic }
"For every <p> inside the section #intro..."

Style elements cascade - they stack from first to most recently applied.

Browser style sheet -> user style sheet -> author style sheet -> inline styles

Users can supply default style sheets in their browsers.

Specificity - Most specific rule gets applied.  If two or more rules are
equally specific, the last one wins.

local style attribute: weight == 1000
ID seletor: weight == 100
attributes and pseudo-classes: weight == 10
element names and pseudo-elements: weight == 1

Twitter Bootstrap
Library of CSS and Javascript to give you a basic framework.
Responsiveness built in.
grid system for positioning blocks
Defaults to 12 columns across, like a newspaper.

<p class="col-lg-4">
<p class="col-lg-10 cold-md-10 col-xs-12">
lg == large screen
md == mobile device (tablet)
sm == small (phone in landscape mode)
xs == very small (phone in vertical mode)
# is the number of columns

div's inside of a Bootstrap page get subdivided into 12 columns themselves.
